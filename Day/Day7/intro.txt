Functions are re-usable blocks of code in JavaScript that perform a specific task. It is used to make code modular and reduce code duplication.Functions are re-usable blocks of code in JavaScript that perform a specific task. It is used to make code modular and reduce code duplication.

In JavaScript, a function is a block of code that can be defined and then called or invoked later in the program. Functions allow you to encapsulate reusable logic, making your code more modular and easier to maintain. 

There are several types of functions in JavaScript:

1. **Named Functions**: These are functions that are declared with a specific name and can be called using that name.

2. **Anonymous Functions**: These are functions that are declared without a name. They are often used as arguments to other functions or assigned to variables.

3. **Arrow Functions**: Introduced in ES6, arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing functions. They are particularly useful for short, inline functions.

4. **Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)**: These are functions that are defined and immediately executed. They are often used to create a local scope for variables to avoid polluting the global scope.

5. **Higher-Order Functions**: These are functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them.

6. **Generator Functions**: Introduced in ES6, generator functions allow you to define an iterative algorithm by writing a single function that can maintain its own state.


Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE):
Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) JavaScript mein ek design pattern hai jisme ek function define kiya jata hai aur phir usko turant invoke kiya jata hai. Yeh ek anonymous function hota hai jo brackets ke andar define kiya jata hai aur phir brackets ke baad call operator () ka istemal karke turant invoke kiya jata hai.

Syntax:

javascript
Copy code
(function() {
    // Code inside the IIFE
})();

Higher-Order Functions:
Higher-Order Functions JavaScript mein aise functions hote hain jo ek function ko argument ke roop mein lete hain ya fir ek function ko return karte hain.

Example (Function as Argument):

javascript
Copy code
function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}

function sayHello(greetingFunction, name) {
    return greetingFunction(name);
}

var message = sayHello(greet, "John");
console.log(message); // Output: Hello, John!

Generator Functions (ES6):
Generator Functions ES6 mein introduce kiye gaye hain. Yeh special type ke functions hote hain jo iterative operations ko control karte hain aur values ko lazily generate karte hain.

Syntax:

javascript
Copy code
function* generatorFunction() {
    // Code for generating values
    yield value;
}
