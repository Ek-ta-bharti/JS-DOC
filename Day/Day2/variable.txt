Variables are like containers for storing data in a computer program. In JavaScript, you can create a variable using the var, let, or const keyword.

var was traditionally used for variable declaration, but let and const are preferred nowadays for better scoping and immutability respectively.
let is used for variables that can be reassigned.
const is used for variables whose value will not change.
