Conditional Statements:
Conditional statements are used in JavaScript to control the code based on conditions. This provides flexibility and decision-making capability in your program.

If statement: This statement checks a condition and if it is true, it executes the associated code block.

else statement: This statement is used along with if statement and if the if condition is false, then it executes the else block.

else if statement: This statement is used to check multiple conditions. If the first condition is false, then the second condition is checked.

Switch statement: This statement checks multiple values of a variable and executes their corresponding code blocks.

In conditional statements you can control your code according to different conditions. Sometimes you have to use one or other conditional statements for some specific cases.
